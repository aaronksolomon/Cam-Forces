## Online Resources
- **[UKC: Black Diamond C4 review](https://www.ukclimbing.com/gear/climbing/protection/black_diamond_camalot_c4-12331)**: An old article (2019) that actually mentions the BD camming angle, 14.5° as well as the industry standard, 13.75°. 
>The camming angle of the new Camalot C4 has been maintained at 14.5°, a little higher than the industry 'standard' 13.75°. A camming angle of 14.5° gives you a fractionally bigger range, but also marginally less camming force when the unit is over-cammed or tipped out. Neither of these pros or cons are significant enough to get too excited about.

Whether this larger angle actually effects the camming force for over- or under- cammed placements is an interesting question. I don't see it in the physics. It give marginally less camming or frictional force *overall* at 14.5°

- **[How Cams Work Part 1 by Wild Country](https://web.archive.org/web/20070629123443/http://www.wildcountry.co.uk/HintsandTips/UnderstandingCams/General/)**: Archived article by Wild Country.

- **[bigwalls.net - CAMS: A Technical Review](https://www.bigwalls.net/climb/camf/#:~:text=Range%20and%20holding%20power%20are,cam%20angles%20near%2014.5%20degrees.)**: John Middendorf (circa 1985) providing a technical review of cams, discussing range, holding power, and cam angles.

- **[An Elastic Model of the Holding Power of Spring Loaded Camming Devices](https://web.mit.edu/custer/www/rocking/cams/cams.body.html#:~:text=Figure%204%20shows%20the%20forces,rock%20surface%20drops%20below%20tan)**: Dave Custer that develops two successive models for spring loaded camming devices used as rock climbing anchors. The first is a rigid body model, which determines the basic shape of the cam and its frictional holding ability. The second, an elastic model, accounts for deformation and material strength, predicting failure modes such as inadequate friction and shear yield failure. 

- **[UIAA Frictional Anchors Requirement UIAA-125, EN-12276](https://www.theuiaa.org/documents/safety-standards/Pictorial_UIAA125%20Frictional%20Anchors.pdf)**: The UIAA standard for frictional anchors, specifically cams, under UIAA-125 and EN-12276. It requires a strength rating of at least 5 kN in two positions: relatively open and relatively closed. 
- **[UIAA Safety Standards](https://www.theuiaa.org/safety-standards/)**: Requirements for other device standards are listed, other info.

- **[Climbing: Physics of the Cam by Skylar Whitcomb](https://youtu.be/N74jOXh2iwI?si=w13iUa4vwjB3WW5a&t=179)**: Youtube video. Explanation of the forces involved in the use of climbing cams. Gives a good explanation of forces, a bit sketchy around the connection between pull force and coefficient friction, but generally looks good.

- **[QC lab: The Beauty and Limitations of Big Cams](https://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en_US/stories/experience-story-qc-lab-big-cams/)**: Good article by BD on large cams. Gives some interesting info on failure types and forces for both large and small cams. And a great quote:
> As a side note it is worth mentioning that as the cam gets closer to 100% retraction the stronger it will be. It is commonly overheard that a cam is weaker when placed at full retraction. Some call this condition being “over-cammed.”  This is not true. The closer that a cam is placed to 100% retraction, the stronger it is. The downside to placing a cam at full retraction is that it might be challenging if not impossible to remove without damaging the cam or rock.
