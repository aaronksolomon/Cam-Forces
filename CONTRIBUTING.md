# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome! Thanks for any contributions! Let's keep things organized while giving everyone the freedom to add ideas and contribute new work.

## How to Contribute

- **Adding Files:** Feel free to add files directly to the main directory *Cam_Forces*. Please ensure your contributions are clearly named and well-documented to help others understand your work.
  
- **Organization:** Consider how your contributions fit within the project structure. If you're unsure, create a new file and add a brief description of its purpose. You can also create a new directory if you have multiple files that go together.

- **Respect Other Contributions:** Please take care not to overwrite or conflict with existing files. Review the project structure before adding new content. If you find bugs or errors, it may be good to check with the author before making changes, you can also post a new issue on the **Issues** tab of the repository.

- **Ask Questions:** If you have any practical questions about using Git (e.g., branching, forking, etc.), there are plenty of resources available. Don't hesitate to ask me (aaronksolomon) in the **Discussions** tab for the project!

## Keep It Simple

- Focus on keeping your contributions straightforward and easy to integrate with the existing project.
- If you're contributing a significant new feature or change, consider creating a new directory or file to keep things organized.

Thank you for contributing!
