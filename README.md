# Cam-Forces
Forces generated by SLCD (Spring Loaded Camming Device), Nuts, Tricams
This projected prompted by the question of Ryan Jenks of HowNot2:

"
How much outward force does a cam put on the rock?  Does it change if it's over cammed vs tipped out?  What happens when you pull over an edge?  How different is it vs a nut vs a tricam?  How much force does a cam hook put on the rock?  In general, this is interesting, if you come across a fragile flake, then it matters.

After 3 years, we are finally getting to test the outward force of gear.  While we make final adjustments to our latest jib/adapter for our pull tester, let's get a baseline on what to expect.  How much force does math say we should get on the rock if you pull down 2kn on a cam, nut, tri-cam? Assume parallel sides for cams and tricams. Assume a 20 degree angle for a nut.

Let's start this discussion here in discord because we have another important step designing the experiment after we set the baseline of what we hypothesize.

So far: A Jupyter Lab file "Cam Forces.ipynb" that computes a baseline expected force for a basic SLCD
